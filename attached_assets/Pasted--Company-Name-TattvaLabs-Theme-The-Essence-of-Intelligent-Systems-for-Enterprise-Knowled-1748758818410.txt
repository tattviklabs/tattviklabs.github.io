* **RAGCore**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation engine
* **GraphMind**: Knowledge graph generator from structured + unstructured data
* **InsightDash**: Real-time KPI dashboard + alert engine
* **ChatCore**: Multilingual, voice-enabled AI assistant engine
* **VectorVault**: Embedding store for rapid semantic search
* **AutoModelOps**: Automated model deployment, versioning & monitoring
* **ChainRunner**: Agent orchestration engine for multi-step tasks
* **ContextOS**: Context management system to retain session state across apps

**Deployment Options:**
